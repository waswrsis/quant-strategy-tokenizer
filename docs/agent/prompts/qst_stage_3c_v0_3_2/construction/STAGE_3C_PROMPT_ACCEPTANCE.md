# Stage 3C Prompt Acceptance

prompt_system_version: qst-stage-3c-v0.3.2.1

## Verdict

The Stage 3C prompt pack is accepted only when local validation, agent prompt tests, CI
prompt-validation, and remote raw artifact checks pass.

## Checklist

- [x] One active prompt system exists.
- [x] Required prompt directories and files exist.
- [x] Markdown prompts are readable multi-section files.
- [x] Golden YAML files parse and include required complete tasks.
- [x] Custom token verify, approve, and execute boundaries are separated.
- [x] Reserved-design tokens are documented as non-executable.
- [x] CI runs prompt validation.

## Evidence

See `construction/STAGE_3C_PROMPT_ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE.md` for command evidence and raw
artifact verification notes.

## Guardrails

- Use current repository evidence before making current-state claims.
- Do not invent token refs, schema fields, capabilities, or runtime behavior.
- Keep reserved design features non-executable and route unsupported behavior explicitly.
- Treat validation, hash stability, and prompt success as engineering evidence only.
