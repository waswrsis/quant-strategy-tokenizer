# QST Stage 3C Agent Prompt Pack

prompt_system_version: qst-stage-3c-v0.3.2.3

## Purpose

This directory preserves the v0.4 compatibility prompt system. It teaches an agent how
to inspect the compatibility surface, select token records, author or repair GKR
strategies, and hand off evidence without relying on stale project memory. Current QST
1.0 work starts from `docs/agent/QST_1_0_AGENT_PROMPT.md` instead.

## Versioning

The directory name remains `qst_stage_3c_v0_3_2` for stable links. The preserved patch
prompt-system version is `qst-stage-3c-v0.3.2.3`.

Previous version: `qst-stage-3c-v0.3.2.2`. It installed operational guidance for repo
context, strategy classification, token selection, GKR authoring, diagnostic repair,
profile gate review, and custom-token routing. The active version adds Coverage Frontier
awareness for matrix, dogfood, external benchmark, false-supported, custom-route, and
kernel-gap evidence.

## How To Use

1. Start with `core/00_FOUNDATION.md`.
2. Choose one load profile from `load_profiles/`.
3. Load only the readers required by the active task.
4. Run the task prompt and produce the report shape it requests.
5. Validate this pack with `tools/validate_prompt_set.py`.

## Boundaries

The prompt pack does not change QST token semantics, hashes, runtime behavior, demos, or
security boundaries. Reserved design token families remain non-executable.
