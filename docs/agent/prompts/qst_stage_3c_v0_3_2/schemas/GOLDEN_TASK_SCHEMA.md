# Golden Task Schema

prompt_system_version: qst-stage-3c-v0.3.2.1
schema_type: prompt_contract

## Purpose

Define intent files used for prompt golden-task validation.

## Required Fields

- golden_task.id, golden_task.name, golden_task.status, golden_task.intent, golden_task.expected

## Validation Rules

- complete tasks must include intent, expected, forbidden_behavior, and acceptance.
- Missing fields must be reported explicitly instead of inferred.
- Output should be deterministic and compact enough for review.

## Output

Return a mapping or report that follows the required field list and preserves unresolved
questions for the next agent.

## Guardrails

- Use current repository evidence before making current-state claims.
- Do not invent token refs, schema fields, capabilities, or runtime behavior.
- Keep reserved design features non-executable and route unsupported behavior explicitly.
- Treat validation, hash stability, and prompt success as engineering evidence only.
