# Module Report Schema

prompt_system_version: qst-stage-3c-v0.3.2.2
schema_type: prompt_contract

## Purpose

Define the review report produced by module readers and audit tasks.

## Required Fields

```yaml
module_report:
  module:
  inspected_files:
  commands_run:
  facts:
  contradictions:
  missing_evidence:
  risks:
  next_reader_or_task:
```

## Validation Rules

- findings must be actionable and ordered by severity.
- Missing fields must be reported explicitly instead of inferred.
- Output should be deterministic and compact enough for review.
- facts must cite files, tests, schemas, docs, command output, or reference artifacts.
- contradictions must separate implementation, tests, docs, and generated artifacts.

## Output

Return a mapping or report that follows the required field list and preserves unresolved
questions for the next agent.

## Guardrails

- Use current repository evidence before making current-state claims.
- Do not invent token refs, schema fields, capabilities, or runtime behavior.
- Keep reserved design features non-executable and route unsupported behavior explicitly.
- Treat validation, hash stability, and prompt success as engineering evidence only.
